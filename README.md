# Python Code
The data analyst course at CareerFoundry was project-based. For learning Python, I did the following project:
# **Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis**
All python coding I did can be found in the Scripts folder
## **Objective**
Perform initial data and exploratory analysis of sales data from "Instacart" to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
## **Context**
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. Therefore, they want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like.
## **Key Questions**
1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day? We want to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
2. Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
3. Group products with different price tags to create a more straightforward price range.
4. Which products are the most popular in each sales department?
5. What is the distribution among users regarding to their brand loyalty (how often do they return to Instacart)?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
7. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customers's region?
8. Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?
9. What different classification does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
10. What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
