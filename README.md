The data analyst course at Careerfoundry is project based. For learning Python I did the following project:
# **Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis**
## **Objective**
Perform initial data and exploratory analysis of sales data from "Instacart" to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
## **Context**
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like.
## **Key Questions**
#### What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day? We want to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
#### Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
#### Group products with different price tags to create a simpler price range.
#### Which products are the most popular in each sales deparment?
#### What is the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyality (how ofthen do they return to instacart)?
#### Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
#### Are there differences in ordering habits based on a cusomers's region?
#### Is there a connection between age and family status in therms of ordering habits?
#### What different classification does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain typs of goods? Family status?
#### What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
## **Data**

## Presentation of findings
#### The findings were presented via an [Excel-Report](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuD1Cerkd4TJr54RVUA3uWvHrS1x4g?e=CEePMZ)
#### All information about the data used and what I did can be found in the project file "Instacart Basket Analysis.zip"
